* Avoid long files. You are encouraged to break long files to smaller files for better readability.
* Avoid introducing command line argparse unless I explicitly asked. Instead, put mock data as an example 
* Remove unused code and imports. Commended code is not considered unused.
* Avoid adding new variables to .env without asking
* Always use python3 to run files
